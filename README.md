# CitiBike NYC to Des Moines
## Module 14 Tableau

## Overview
During a visit to New York City with a friend Kate, a potential business idea started to emerge.  The trip became a very nice experience due to the use of CitiBike, a bike sharing program that allowed us to tour the city's famous tourist highlights like The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building and Central Park while interacting with the people of NYC.  The question is if a similar type of business could be implemented logistically in our home town of Des Moines where we have a potential investor.  We will first see how it works in New York City using data analytics so we can apply that knowledge for our business idea for Des Moines.

## Analysis and Results
Using various visualizations on Tableau worksheets, an analysis of the graphically represented data was as follows:
* Total number of rides in August: 2,344,224
* Of the above total: 1,900,359 were SUBSCRIBERS to the bikesharing program; 443,869 were other CUSTOMERS (including tourists)
* Of the above total: 588,431, were FEMALE; 1,530,272 were MALE; and 225,521 were "unknown"
* The peak hours of use were between 7:00AM - 10:00AM; bikeshare use gradually rose from 12 Noon onwards peaking again between 5:00PM - 7:00PM.  This mirrors typical commuter morning and evening "rush" hours including a busy "lunchtime".
* The TOP STARTING LOCATIONS & TOP ENDING LOCATIONS visualizations were represented by SYMBOL MAPS.  These showed that the most popular locations for starts & stops were along the Hudson River on the western side of Manhattan bordered by Lower Manhattan and Greenwich Village.  Ironically the area around Central Park, a popular landmark in itself is not represented much if at all on these visualizations although it would be considered a popular spot for biking.
* The "AVERAGE TRIP DURATION" Fill Chart was a bit puzzling.  The showed that most riders with an average age in their early to mid-30-YEAR old range used the bike sharing program the most, however there was an unusual peak with riders that were born between 1890-1893.  That would make the riders in this peak age range roughly 110-113 years old.  Further analysis may need to be done to determine why this peak is higher that all the rest.
* The BIKE REPAIRS is a TREEMAP visualization and shows bike useage per Bike ID and clearly shows which bikes are used/shared the most (on the top left) ranging to the least used (on the bottom right).
* The BIKE UTILIZATION visualization uses a PACKED BUBBLE display.  I found this visualiztion pleasing but ultimately too random to be of any logistical use, especially for a business proposal.

## Results of Each Visualization for CHALLENGE portion

[CHECKOUT TIMES FOR USERS](https://public.tableau.com/views/CITIBIKEPROPOSALNYCtoDESMOINES/CITIBIKEPROPOSALFORDESMOINES?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This line graph visualization shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.  It shows over 140,000 bikes are checked out and their duration of uses continues throughout over an average 24 hour period.

[CHECKOUT TIMES BY GENDER](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FC3W4T3JK?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This visualization is multi-line graph that shows the length of time bikes are checked out broken down by gender-type.  It clearly shows more riders are male while less than half the ridership is female followed by the 'unknown' category.

[NUMBER OF TRIPS (WEEKDAYS) BY HOUR](https://public.tableau.com/shared/WSH4M6HFY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This visualization is a Heat-Map that shows the number of trips by hour for each weekday.  Surprisingly the hours between 5:00pm - 6:00pm on Thursday had the most ridership with over 43,000 rides calculated.  Perhaps running errands before the weekend starts.

[TRIPS BY GENDER (WEEKDAYS) BY HOUR](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZTXWXTHGT?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This visualization is similar to the previous Heat-Map but adds the gender category to how and when ridership can vary between genders.  Also similar to the previous visualization is the female ridership on Thursday between 5:00PM - 6:00PM which numbers over 10,000 and goes up and over 11,000 by 6:00PM.  Male ridership peaked at 5:00PM on Thursdays also with 25,256 but was busy from 4:00PM on Thursdays too.  Male ridership was also high during Saturday with over 10,000 as early as 9:00AM and bike usage staying consistent until 8:00PM

[USER TRIPS BY GENDER & USER TYPE](https://public.tableau.com/shared/3QFWC2D8J?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This Heat-Map breaks down variances between subscribers and customers by their gender for each day of the week.  While the customer bracket was pretty even across the genders, the subscribers who participated in bike usage were mostly male during the latter half of the week.

[STOPTIMES FOR AUGUST - ORIGINAL VISUALIZATION](https://public.tableau.com/shared/69RSZNR35?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This visualization shows number of bike stoptimes by hour for each user type: customers and subscribers.  It is a bar graph version based on the TOP STOP LOCATIONS but displayed over a 24-hour period and grouped by customers and subscribers for the month of August.  It was one I came up with while trying different variations of Tableau features.  As my instructor Steven Green put it "you just gotta play around with it."

[BIKE MAINTENANCE TREEMAP (from MODULE)](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZWZN72NR3?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This TREEMAP shows the bike utilization for each bike organized by BIKE ID.  Between this and the PACKED BUBBLE visualization, I prefer this one (as I indicated above) due to it being more organized.  This could be very helpful in identifying bikes that get more use and may need regular and/or additional upkeep and maintenance for continued ridership use.

[TOP BIKE STARTING LOCATIONS (from MODULE)](https://public.tableau.com/shared/XRJKMCKCP?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This symbol map represents the top starting locations for CITIBIKE docking stations in New York City.  For this SYMBOL MAP to not have much, if any symbols representing the Central Park area was a surprise.  Perhaps it is too busy an area for bike usage or CITIBIKE has not expanded to this area as of yet.  For there not to be any during the month of August was again, a surprise.


## Summary

[CITIBIKE PROPOSAL FOR DES MOINES](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/takemi.oshiro/viz/CITIBIKEPROPOSALNYCtoDESMOINES/CITIBIKEPROPOSALFORDESMOINES)

The data based visualizations clearly shows that a bike sharing program could be launched in a city like New York which is heavily congested in most parts and using a bicycle would save on fuel costs, time and would promote "going GREEN" to help the environment.  I believe it would be popular in Des Moines as well where many Bio-Agriculture, Healthcare and Insurance companies have their corporate headquarters.  Although Des Moines has a lot of hiking and biking trails already, the one drawback is they have no attractive "tourist attractions" for regular customers.  Des Moines has no professional sports teams or natural landmark attractions like a beach or National Park also.  They would have to promote subscribership more than for customers use unless it is for someone visiting one of the companies based there, family or friends.

What people, possible investors and customers alike will appreciate is saving money.  If additional data towards this goal can be obtained, I believe it would help with the CITIBIKE PROPOSAL for DES MOINES. 

SUGGESTION ONE: would be a visualization of fuel costs versus bike sharing program costs.
SUGGESTION TWO: would be a visualization of vehicle accident costs versus bike sharing program costs.  The insurance and healthcare companies in Des Moines would probably promote this as well.

On a personal note, I initially thought of making various visualizations would be enjoyable.  My enjoyment was a bit set back by how difficult Tableau, at least the Tableau Public version was to navigate through.  I had to upload the data 3 times so I could start the Module classwork each time taking about 30 minutes for it to load.  During the Challenge portion, two of my visualizations simply disappeared leaving me with nothing but a black screen.  I had to re-do and re-do and re-do a couple of visualizations on this platform.  I suppose if you made visualizations only on this platform, you would get used to the intricacies, but one could say there are too many options if you are just starting out to learn this platform.  That being said, the visualizations were very appealing to the eye.
