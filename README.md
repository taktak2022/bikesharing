# NYC CitiBike to Des Moines
## Module 14 Tableau

## Overview
During a visit to New York City with a friend Kate, a potential business idea started to emerge.  The trip became a very nice experience due to the use of CitiBike, a bike sharing program that allowed us to tour the city's famous tourist highlights like The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building and Central Park while interacting with the people of NYC.  The question is if a similar type of business could be implemented logistically in our home town of Des Moines where we have a potential investor.  We will first see how it works in New York City using data analytics so we can apply that knowledge for our business idea for Des Moines.

## Analysis and Results
Using various visualizations on Tableau worksheets, an analysis of the graphically represented data was as follows:
* Total number of rides in August: 2,344,224
* Of the above total: 1,900,359 were SUBSCRIBERS to the bikesharing program; 443,869 were other CUSTOMERS (including tourists)
* Of the above total: 588,431, were FEMALE; 1,530,272 were MALE; and 225,521 were "unknown"
* The peak hours of use were between 7:00AM - 10:00AM; bikeshare use gradually rose from 12 Noon onwards peaking again between 5:00PM - 7:00PM.  This mirrors typical commuter morning and evening "rush" hours including a busy "lunchtime".
* The "AVERAGE TRIP DURATION" Fill Chart was a bit puzzling.  The showed that most riders with an average age in their early to mid-30-YEAR old range used the bike sharing program the most, however there was an unusual peak with riders that were born between 1890-1893.  That would make the riders in this peak age range roughly 110-113 years old.  Further analysis may need to be done to determine why this peak is higher that all the rest.
