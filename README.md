# CitiBike NYC to Des Moines
## Module 14 Tableau

## Overview
During a visit to New York City with a friend Kate, a potential business idea started to emerge.  The trip became a very nice experience due to the use of CitiBike, a bike sharing program that allowed us to tour the city's famous tourist highlights like The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building and Central Park while interacting with the people of NYC.  The question is if a similar type of business could be implemented logistically in our home town of Des Moines where we have a potential investor.  We will first see how it works in New York City using data analytics so we can apply that knowledge for our business idea for Des Moines.

## Analysis and Results
Using various visualizations on Tableau worksheets, an analysis of the graphically represented data was as follows:
* Total number of rides in August: 2,344,224
* Of the above total: 1,900,359 were SUBSCRIBERS to the bikesharing program; 443,869 were other CUSTOMERS (including tourists)
* Of the above total: 588,431, were FEMALE; 1,530,272 were MALE; and 225,521 were "unknown"
* The peak hours of use were between 7:00AM - 10:00AM; bikeshare use gradually rose from 12 Noon onwards peaking again between 5:00PM - 7:00PM.  This mirrors typical commuter morning and evening "rush" hours including a busy "lunchtime".
* The TOP STARTING LOCATIONS & TOP ENDING LOCATIONS visualizations were represented by SYMBOL MAPS.  These showed that the most popular locations for starts & stops were along the Hudson River on the western side of Manhattan bordered by Lower Manhattan and Greenwich Village.  Ironically the area around Central Park, a popular landmark in itself is not represented much if at all on these visualizations although it would be considered a popular spot for biking.
* The "AVERAGE TRIP DURATION" Fill Chart was a bit puzzling.  The showed that most riders with an average age in their early to mid-30-YEAR old range used the bike sharing program the most, however there was an unusual peak with riders that were born between 1890-1893.  That would make the riders in this peak age range roughly 110-113 years old.  Further analysis may need to be done to determine why this peak is higher that all the rest.
* The BIKE REPAIRS is a TREEMAP visualization and shows bike useage per Bike ID and clearly shows which bikes are used/shared the most (on the top left) ranging to the least used (on the bottom right).
* The BIKE UTILIZATION visualization uses a PACKED BUBBLE display.  I found this visualiztion pleasing but ultimately too random to be of any logistical use, especially for a business proposal.

## Results of Each Visualization for CHALLENGE portion

### CHECKOUT TIMES FOR USERS: 
This line graph visualization shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

### CHECKOUT TIMES BY GENDER:
This visualization is multi-line graph that shows the length of time bikes are checked out broken down by gender-type.

### NUMBER OF TRIPS (WEEKDAYS) BY HOUR:
This visualization is a Heat-Map that shows the number of trips by hour for each weekday.  Surprisingly the hours between 5:00pm - 6:00pm on Thursday had the most ridership with over 43,000 rides calculated.

### TRIPS BY GENDER (WEEKDAYS) BY HOUR
This visualization is similar to the previous Heat-Map but adds the gender category to how and when ridership can vary between genders.

### USER TRIPS BY GENDER & USER TYPE
This Heat-Map breaks down variances between subscribers and customers by their gender for each day of the week.

### STOPTIMES FOR AUGUST (* ORIGINAL VISUALIZATION *)
This visualization shows number of bike stoptimes by hour for each user type: customers and subscribers.
