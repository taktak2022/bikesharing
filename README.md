# NYC CitiBike to Des Moines
## Module 14 Tableau

## Overview
During a visit to New York City with a friend Kate, a potential business idea started to emerge.  The trip became a very nice experience due to the use of CitiBike, a bike sharing program that allowed us to tour the city's famous tourist highlights like The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building and Central Park while interacting with the people of NYC.  The question is if a similar type of business could be implemented logistically in our home town of Des Moines where we have a potential investor.  We will first see how it works in New York City using data analytics so we can apply that knowledge for our business idea for Des Moines.
